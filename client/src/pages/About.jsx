              <p>
                Hi, I‚Äôm Winifred ‚Äî a wife, a mom to two little lights of the world, and a Goal Coach for godly ambitious women. My mission is to help women gain clarity, build belief, embrace discipline, and align with their God-given purpose so they can rise with confidence and live fulfilled lives.

              </p>
              <p>
                My story is rooted in faith. From a young age, I believed our lives were meant to shine as lights for God, and I‚Äôve carried that conviction into motherhood, ministry, and coaching. Today, I walk alongside women who know they‚Äôre called to more but need structure, support, and strategy to get there ‚Äî without losing sight of who they are in Christ.

              </p>
              <p>
                I also serve as a volunteer kids‚Äô educator in church, and it was there that my love for children‚Äôs discipleship grew. That passion later inspired me to create Christ-centered books and resources that help families introduce little ones to their true identity in Christ.

              </p>
              <p>
                Through my frameworks and one-on-one work, I help ambitious women move from scattered to focused, from uncertain to clear, and from overwhelmed to aligned. Because when women rise in clarity and purpose, they not only transform their own lives but also influence their families, communities, and the next generation.

              </p>
              <p>
               At the heart of everything, I‚Äôm a woman who loves Jesus, loves people, and believes in building a life that is both purposeful and impactful.
              </p>
              {/* <p>
                At the heart of it all, I'm just a woman who loves Jesus, loves people, and believes every child deserves to know they are chosen, loved, and created with a divine purpose.
