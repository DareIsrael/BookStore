              <p>
                Hi, I'm Winifred ‚Äî a mom to two little lights of the world, a Goal Coach for godly ambitious women, and an author passionate about helping children discover who they are in Christ.
              </p>
              <p>
                My story is deeply rooted in faith. From a young age, I've believed that our lives are meant to shine as lights for God, and I've carried that conviction into motherhood, ministry, and my work.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a volunteer kids' educator in church, I've had the privilege of teaching little ones about God's Word in simple, creative, and joyful ways. It's there, sitting on the floor with crayons, storybooks, and Bible verses, that I saw how children's hearts are wide open to God's truth. This experience sparked my passion for creating Christ-centered resources that help families disciple their children at home.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through my Christian kids' books ‚Äî from coloring books to A‚ÄìZ Bible name stories ‚Äî my mission is to make God's Word fun, memorable, and alive for children, while supporting parents in their role as spiritual nurturers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond children's ministry, I also serve as a Goal Coach for women of faith. I help godly ambitious women gain clarity, build belief, embrace discipline, and align with their God-given purpose ‚Äî because when mothers and women rise in Christ, they pass that light on to the next generation.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the heart of it all, I'm just a woman who loves Jesus, loves people, and believes every child deserves to know they are chosen, loved, and created with a divine purpose.
